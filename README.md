# Check-Point

**Check-Point** is a full-stack video game review web app, much like Letterboxd. Users can find their favorite games and write reviews. They can favorite or even wishlist games they haven't played. As video games become more and more popular, the gameplay/mechanics, story telling etc., all tend to evolve and people should have an application that allows them to share their thoughts all in one unique place.

## Next Steps:

- Adding a profile model, so users can check out other users statistics e.g. How many reviews they've written, average score, favorited games and their video game lists.
- Adding a list model so that users can add games to their lists to curate their own sort of lists. Turing the favorites and wishlist also into lists so users can see all the games that are their favorites and remind them of games they haven't played yet that are on their wishlists.
- Adding a way for wishlists to be checked by users when they haven't played a game they want to. When they have played the game that is wishlisted, and write a review the game is taken off of the wishlist and the wishlist button is removed for that game for that user.
- Adding a youtube API to show trailers for the games.
- Adding a video games news page for upcoming games that users are excited for.
